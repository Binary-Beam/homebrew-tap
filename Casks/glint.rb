  # Unsigned beta: brew applies the com.apple.quarantine flag on download, which
  # makes Gatekeeper block first launch. Strip it after install so a plain
  # `brew install --cask glint` opens cleanly. No sudo/password needed —
  # /Applications is admin-writable. DELETE this block once the app is notarized.
